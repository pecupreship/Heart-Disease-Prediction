This project downloaded its heart disease dataset from kaggle with fourteen features:
(age	sex	cp	trestbps	chol	fbs	restecg	thalach	exang	oldpeak	slope	ca	thal	target)
Data Analysis was performed on the dataset and the predictive model used is Logistic Regression
that is vast at prediction.
Accuracy_score is used to measure the model accuracy which is 80%. Predictive model was also built
to test input for prediction
